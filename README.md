# LogicProjectDPLL
Brute Force and DPLL's Algorithm

# Instructions

## 1. Download or clone the project in your machine.

You can clone it using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), but also
you can download it by clicking [here](https://github.com/martspain/LogicProjectDPLL/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

## 2. Make sure you have Python 3 up and running.

If you want to check whether you have the right version or simply check if its installed you can do it by following the steps [here.](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/check-python-version)

## 3. Open the project in your favorite IDE or Text Editor

If you are not sure which editor to use, we recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## 4. Run the main file

Make sure you run **formulaReader.py**.

## 5. Choose your options and enter data correctly

If you choose **Option 1: Brute Force Algorithm**, make sure you enter the formula using this syntax:

   `< [{(p, False), (q, False)}, {(p, True), (r, True)}] >`

Else if you choose **Option 2: DPLL's Algorithm**, make sure you enter what you want to test in the **example.txt** file using the following syntax:

   `< !p !r s !q p !s >`

## 6. Enjoy the Math :)
